#es6 (& nearly no es7)
Collated and presented by Marwan Butrous <!-- .element: class="small" -->

Note:
- Thank Mark and Cliff for opportunity to present.

- Encourage others who want to share knowledge

- Point out that non-food and other teams are using es6, and I'm sure would be happy
to discuss their experiences and work flow with you.
