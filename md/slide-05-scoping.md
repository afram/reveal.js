##Block Scoping
####Block scoping introduces new declaration forms for defining variables scoped to a single block. This includes:

<div class="small">
- **let**: syntactically similar to *var*, but defines a variable in the current block
- **const**: like *let*, but for read-only constant declarations

- ( **function**: allow *function* declarations in nested blocks )

Note:
- introduces 2 new keywords

- won't touch on 'function' as identical in usage to let

- difference between function scoping and block scoping.

- only function scope

- Hoisting in function scope
